## Device Drivers & Problems (2 min)

## Project Aim (1 min)

## Rust (3 min)

One of the main components in this project, especially with regard to development, is Rust for Linux. As a bit of background....
+ Builds on groundwork laid by gaynor and co in 2019
+ Started 2020
+ Recently incorporated into Linux with kernel version 6.1

Rust is a relatively young system language focused on memory safety
+ Several features, attractive to this project

... though not perfect, crit by stroustrup
+ Unsafe for Rust is necessary
+ Haskell similarly has backdoors so having a backdoor isn't some kind of gotcha


## Memory Safety (3 min)
So memory unsafety can be defined as....

Left: Table of stats from an article by Alex Gaynor.

The average % of vulns of these code bases is 71%

## The Great Below (5 min)

### Progress
Since the interim report I have....

+ Improved interim report content
+ Dissertation writing, almost halfway through

### Development
Detail development steps....
+ Recompiling existing kernel to Linux 6.1
+ Recompiling that kernel to enable Rust
+ After this, tested Rust samples to verify all works

Demo before ending with questions.
