## Abstract
+ Propretary device drivers for embedded systems typically lack quality due to little code auditing
+ New solution to improve reliability and safety of drivers without changing the kernel; Rewriting drivers in Rust (focused on third party developers)
	+ Can help developers detect security issues at compile time (language model)
+ Developed framework to help in quickly building Rust drivers
+ Made use of security features in Rust to create more infrastructure for developers, so its  easier for them to utilise kernel memory allocation & concurrency management, this also solves common bugs
+ Tested on Raspberry Pi 3
+ Evaluation shows drivers generated by this framework have acceptable executable size for official/common embeded systems, runtime overhead is insignificant

## Introduction
+ Definition (and common uses) of Operating Systems: "... control the hardware connected to computers, and provide an universal well-defined interface for userspace applications to interact with different devices"
+ "Unfortunately, device drivers have become one of the most sgnificant source of complexity and vulnerability for computing systems."
	+ Drivers account for more than 60% of Linux kernel codebase
	+ A recent study shows driver code is the most vulnerable within the kernel (see docs in `Documents/Linux Faults and Issues`)
	+ Issues exacerbated by monolithic architecture of the Linux kernel which allows drivers to run with kernel permission and effectively do whatever they wish
+ This situation is even worse for 3rd party devs due to little scrutiny and general low quality of products
	+ 2016, Google reported around 85% of Android kernel bugs occurred in vendor drivers
	+ Various projects were proposed to solve the issue such as hardware, software & language based isolation, micro-kernel architecture, user-space device drivers.
	+ Most of these solutions **indeed** protect drivers against common exploits but they also need to modify the kernel itself or should have support from extra hardware
	+ Some methods also have unacceptable overheads
+ Idea of using Rust
	+ leverage compilers powerful type system, prevent developers from making mistakes that then become attack vectors for hackers
	+ Most security checks are performed at compile time so several errors are detected before the driver is even deployed
	+ The method produces insignificant overhead and there is no requirement of modifying the kernel
+ ##### Rust (programming language)
	+ strongly typed
	+ focus on memory safety, concurrency and performance
	+ enforces safety guarantees at compile time which generates little runtime overhead (other langs like Java/C# need to garbage collect at runtime)
	+ designed for safe system-level programming
	+ Ownership system which avoids bugs like use-after-free
	+ Borrow checker tracks references to ensure they're always valid, clears dangling ptrs and other mem corruptions
	+ No garbage collection for mem mgmt, records lifetime of allocation(s) and statically determines when to deallocate resources
	+ Its possible for Rust to perform within the same range of C/C++
