Most device drivers created through kernel modules. 
Kernel space and User space are separated.
Kernel space isn't compartmentalised so for kernel/driver code it is basically the wild west.
Uses a build system to link code and object files to .ko executables.


Most materials that I use for learning Linux modules/device drivers have not been recently created which showcases that Linux drivers have not evolved or developed much in the last decade or two.
+ [This kernel device model page](https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/driver-model/overview.html) was drafted 26/08/2002 and later updated 31/01/2006. This was first drafted over 1 month before I was born. 
+ [Linux Device Drivers 3 Book](https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/) was published/released in 2005.
+ [This YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-NwyLyw_-FUQrvXmyW_BA/videos) which I previously  used to learn Linux drivers during college, released these Linux Device Driver training videos in September 2014.
