+ Memory recovery feature built into programming languages
+ Such languages can include one or more garbage collectors which automatically frees memory that was allocated to objects no longer used or required by the program
+ The reclaimed memory can be used again for future object allocations


+ Ensures that a program doesn't exceed its allocated memory or reach a point at which it can no longer function
+ Also frees devs from having to manually manage program memory and reduces potential for memory-related problems
+ Older languages see the dev manually delete objects and free memory. These manual processes made it easier to introduce bugs into the code.

+ Garbage collector auto detects when an object isn't needed and removes it, freeing the memory used by the object without affecting objects that are still in use.
