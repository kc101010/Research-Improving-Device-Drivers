Zivuku, S. (2021) "Linus Torvalds: "C++ is really a terrible language!" ". [Online] Medium. Available: https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/linus-torvalds-c-is-really-a-terrible-language-2248b839bee3 [Accessed 5 December 2022]

His opinion is that C++ is a bad language. He has shared this as early as 2007.

"C++ ended up with a bunch of terrible, unmaintainable garbage"
characteristics of C++ are basically useless
"C++ is just a waste, there is no design at all, just adding some scum on top of C"
