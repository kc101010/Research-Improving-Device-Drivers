[Rust-Written Apple DRM Linux Kernel Driver Renders First Cube](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-Apple-DRM-Cube-Milestone)

Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver written in Rust to support Apple M1/M1 GPU - Developer is a VTuber focused on running Linux on Apple Silicon.

Achieved milestone of being able to render a spinning cube with appropriate user-space code - driver is still in early stages and doesn't currently have HDMI output.

Lina has previously drawn a triangle on M1 using an open-source driver which is now progressing towards becoming a working Linux driver stack. 

The DRM kernel is set to be the first GPU kernel driver written Rust and to be dependant on the upcoming Rust Linux Kernel infrastructure.

User-space; Mesa Gallium3D AGX driver for Apple M1/M2 gfx to have OpenGL support.

Asahi Linux on Apple silicon hardware is fairly usable w/o the use of accelerated graphics.
