[Rust programming language: Driving innovation in unexpected places](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-why-these-developers-like-rust-in-their-cars/)

Software Engineers at Volvo have discussed why the enjoy Rust and why it's good for a car. 

Article notes that more and more people, companies, organisations are embracing Rust.

Rust is a relatively young language that helps developers avoid memory related bugs that C and C++ do not automatically, hence Rust's growing popularity in systems programming. Memory related bugs are the most common severe security issues, [according to Microsoft and Google's Chrome team](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/).

Volvo engineers bring an embedded systems point of view to the table. 

The main benefits he sees from Rust include: not having to think about race conditions and memory corruption, and memory safety in general. "You know, just writing correct and robust code from the start," he said.

Gustavsson says he started bringing Rust into Volvo with the Low Power node of the core computer.

Gustavsson sees a bright future for Rust in Volvo but that doesn't mean using it to replace already working code that's been adequately tested. ==He notes that new Rust code can co-exist with "almost arbitrary granularity" with existing C and C++ and that it could make sense to cherry pick parts to rewrite Rust if that component needs cybersecurity.

"We want to expand Rust here at Volvo Cars to enable it on more nodes and to do that, we need to get compiler support for certain hardware targets and OS support for other targets. ==There is no point in replacing already developed and well-tested code, but code developed from scratch should definitely be developed in Rust, if at all feasible.

 =="That is not to say that Rust is a panacea. Rust has some rough edges still and it requires you to make certain trade-offs that may not always be the best course of action. But overall, I think Rust has huge potential to allow us to produce higher quality code up front at a lower cost which in turn would reduce our warranty costs, so it's a win-win for the bottom line," he said.

Autosar, automotive standards group, announced a new subgroup within the WG-SAF group to explore ==How rust could be used in one of its reference platforms

SAE international also set up a task force to ==look at Rust in the automotive industry for safety-related systems
