Want to simplify workflow for building models. Address Runtime speed, memory consumption and overall relibability as is  needed for machine learning deployments running at scale. 

Python is the current industry standard.

"idiomatic Rust is about 10x faster than native SQL, embedded PL/pgSQL and pure Python."

The crate that they're using has improved development cycle over the one used for Python. Streamlines extension creation in Rust.

Libraries used are implemented in C/C++ and just have bindings available.

Developed a Python compatability layer to resolve any issues when using code between Python and Rust.
