[A profile and list of publications form the Software Reliability Group at IC London]([Alastair Donaldson - Software Reliability Group (ic.ac.uk)](http://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/alastair-donaldson/))
This resource lists publications between 2016 and 2022, I assume they mostly consist of papers for Imperial College?

Holds most recent info

[Pantazis Deligiannis - Multicore Programming Group](https://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/pantazis-deligiannis/)
So Deligiannis is working on a couple of interesting things
(Make sure to look for researchgate profile? )

First, he might be continuing work on Whoop/WHOOPS (latest commit to WHOOP was 2016 )

Second, he is working on a new language called P# which is a new event-driven async 
programming language co-designed with static data race analysis and systematic testing.

P# could be an interesting research avenue as it sounds like it tries to take the burden away from drivers and tries to fix things through the code itself.

Seems to be a lot of focus on using state-machines within the tools used to improve drivers
