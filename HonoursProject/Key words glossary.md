[non-trivial](https://www.yourdictionary.com/nontrivial): not lightweight, any task that is not quick and easy to accomplish. May mean extremely difficult and time consuming

PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect

 [nondeterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm) - "In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), a **nondeterministic algorithm** is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that, even for the same input, can exhibit different behaviors on different runs, as opposed to a [deterministic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm "Deterministic algorithm")."

Data Race - occurs when 2 separate threads access a location of shared memory. At least one is a write, at least one is non-atomic (unchangeable). There is no mechanism to prevent simultaneous access. Races are commonly avoided by protecting programs statements that access a shared resource with locks which form critical sections. 

OSDI  -Operating System Design & Implementation
Hetergenous - not from the same source, individual

[Mutex (Mutual exclusion object)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/mutex) - locking method to allow several threads to take turns in accessing a shared resource

[Interleaving (data) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaving_(data)#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20interleaving%20of%20data%20refers%20to%20the,z2%20z3%20w0%20w1%20w2%20w3%20is%20not.) - interspersing of fields or channels of different meaning sequentially in memory, in processor registers or in file formats

[Combinatorial explosion - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) (I assume this is the right thing) - rapid growth of the complexity of a problem due to how the combinatronics are affected by the input, contraints and bounds of the problem. With Computing, the explosion can occur in computing environments in a way analagous to communications and multi-dimensional space.
