 [nondeterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm) - "In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), a **nondeterministic algorithm** is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that, even for the same input, can exhibit different behaviors on different runs, as opposed to a [deterministic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm "Deterministic algorithm")."

Data Race - occurs when 2 separate threads access a location of shared memory. At least one is a write, at least one is non-atomic (unchangeable). There is no mechanism to prevent simultaneous access. Races are commonly avoided by protecting programs statements that access a shared resource with locks which form critical sections.

Hetergenous - not from the same source, individual

[Mutex (Mutual exclusion object)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/mutex) - locking method to allow several threads to take turns in accessing a shared resource.
