+ Abstractions
	+ Develop a driver the same driver in Rust and C++ and measure both performance
	+ Test Rust driver with nooks and similar subsystems to compare performance against C/C++ drivers
	+ Performance critical code remains C/C++, other code converted to Rust/Java/Golang????
	+ Creating some sort of new tool similar to Nooks?	
+ Modern Languages
	+ Possibly Carbon (Googles C++) will be some sort of breakthrough, can utilise native C++
