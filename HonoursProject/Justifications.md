### Use of Linux, Linux kernel modules.
+ Linux is free and open source so is more accessible than that of Windows and Apple
	+ Apple software is effectively limited to Apple hardware, which I don't already have
	+ Windows 10/11 have costs, there would be unnecessary overhead trying to obtain 2 new machines that use Windows.
+ I already have experience in Linux, it is an OS that I'm fairly familiar with and have worked extensively with
	+ My workstation already runs Ubuntu
	+ I studied Unix/Linux as a module last year
	+ Studied systems programmming concepts which covered systems programming for Linux
