*Interim report feedback*
Font too large on front sheet
Different pages for ToC, ToF, Abstract
New page for a new section
Code excerpts should use a text-based render - different text fonts from machines might cause issues down the line, more convenient to copy code excerpts
Keep less than half the page full with code excerpts. Around a third or a half. Code is all saved in repo, might want to tag the repo to insert into dissertation

*Abstract*
Start with Memory safety
Can try the abstract the again
Line up font on abstract

*Spelling mistake*
Page 5 immediately

Diary has a good home in the interim report but won't translate into dissertation
Management report could stand separately from dissertation and could hold diaries as appendices - Github commit history? 

Be sure to insert project spec as appendice
