+ Improved writing from interim report
+ Contacted more industry figures - this is a dedicated subsection within my background section which details who I've contacted and their feedback/advice etc
	+ Miguel Ojeda (resp)
	+ Alex Gaynor (resp)
	+ Asahi Lina (no resp)
+ More content written into dissertation, sitting at 3,900 words.
	+ General Concepts section - short notes on key concepts; Kernel, User/Kernel space, etc
	+ OS Drivers and differents - written about Linux, Windows, Apple and FreeBSD
	+ Currently expanding memory safety section with garbage collection, more to be added as per feedback
	+ Expanded on Rust section - Discussed Rust for Linux & its background, Criticisms of Rust

Rust USB
+ Previously had issues building, example documentation seemed unreliable
+ More work has popped up with a full sample able to build though none of the work has been merged (as of writing)
+ As discussed, this is an issue which affects the project deliverable

As briefly discussed, would it be suitable to swap the marking for Literature review and Development sections. 

Main focus now
+ Starting presentation (remember to ask expectations)
+ Contuing dissertation writing, post presentation this will be the main task

---

A-class submission for interim report.

Possibly use Yakos full repo.
Should just open an issue to ask about use.

Send Paul Yakos repo link after meeting.

Maybe a modular driver with USB and for Mouse.

Communication might help solve the problems.

Don't let the problem stop me from trying to work on the project.
Don't give in but time running out isn't bad

General concepts could go very nicely in background section.

Haskell - Glasgow Uni, Haskell Currie. No functions allow I/O. MONADS. No global variables, everythings pure. Similarly has backdoors. Should make a comparison between Rust and Haskell. Very comparable. 

Happy to hear every and re-state project for presentation. Explain to Moderator.
Structure can be similar to dissertation.  Tell what you want to tell.
