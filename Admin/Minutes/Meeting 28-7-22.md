### Notes (as written on paper)
+ Quite a rare subject
+ Parallel programming
+ Chandler Carruthers
	+ LLVM
	+ C++ Commitee
	
+ Carbon
	+ Doesn't have mem safety
	+ Building on LLVM
	+ Lean C++
	
+ C++
	+ Optimisation, undefined behaviours
	
+ Rust
	+ Dev idea works
	+ Answers scientific question

Take an existing driver & improve

***

+ Research rust and drivers

+ Research by MS on Rust, taking it farther

+ Tools are much more younger
	+ Build on core ideas of rust

+ C & Rust & Analysis
	+ Good idea!!!

(#) of memory-related issues
	- Proper mem mgmt

GPU used for normal calculations, GPGU

Write similar to C/C++ but not the same, a subset

<u>Software Fuzzing</u>
Fuzzing
- Reliably expose weakness
- Randomly mutate code
- Make syntax errors
- Simple brute-force method

Money & appetite
Very employable project

*** 
CodePlay bought over by intel

Which type of driver?

User-level driver?
	- Client-level bluetooth reader
	- Cliet-level interface
	- C API's

<u> Ideas </u>
Arduino (read from Serial port?)
USB stick (pass through to VM)
                 (old computer hardware
                 that is useless)
Raspberry Pi (SSH)
Trade-off between VM & Pi

Mouse, keyboard, USB
Whatevers most fun

*** 

Quite likely to go ahead

Starting early isn't an advantage
