Don't overthink it, don't hide reader from bad news.

Final meeting after first draft submission to discuss said submission.

Development:
+ Write exactly what I did - produce more text than expected
+ Code excerpts - be picky, take up less than half of the page - each one smaller than that
+ Try to use a text figure rather than a jpeg
+ Ideally, use text and keep everything consecutive. Good idea: size would be about same size of document text

Ask about acknowledgement.
+ Just thank people.
+ Anyone
+ 2/3 sentences
+ Dedicate the document to them

Should consider codeplay, employees have went onto big companies - a lot of work with compilers, LLVM. C++ Clang is a big part. Maybe look into building and slight modifications. 
A lot go straight to AMD

High-performance Computing, code running as fast as possible. Starts with little C++ programs. MPI lang, hard to learn on own. High performance computing @ Edinburgh. OpenMP, pragmas. MPI makes code run very quickly.
