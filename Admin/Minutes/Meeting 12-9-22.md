`make VERBOSE=1` - allows insight into commands being run by makefile, take commands and break the process down by running the commands -> this might allow me to create bindings into rust

making and/or looking into mistakes/vulnerabilities in rust

good reserach should always explain to peers

idea of research question
devise a question that doesn't have an obvious answer

user-study is possible

about whether ideas can improve performance and then benchmark

best to spend next few months to learn how to improve reliability etc
keep reading literature and see how it can link
see if you can measure safety before and after a problem

create as good a research question as possible

narrowing down research question will inform scope
what do you imagine you would create

final output can be driver that controls physical device

### Project spec sheet
Don't rush proj spec doc

resolve essential research question

### Moderator
Possible to ask
