# Honours workshop - 10/10/22
## Lecture 5 - Interim report (10%)

Presentation covered in the first lecture in T2.
Not worth much in the end but every mark counts and adds up.

Due Friday 25th November 2022 - 6 weeks. Submitted through Aula and Turnitin.

Try not to fall behind, don't relax after the project spec as that is a common trap where people wind up falling behind.

Start working as soon as possible.

Early draft to supervisor at least 1 week before submission date. 

Guide word count: 2,500 - 3000 words.
Though this length depends on the type of project undertaken i.e. developmental or investigative.

Content of the interim report could potentially be used within the final report - especially in a expanded and enhanced way.
