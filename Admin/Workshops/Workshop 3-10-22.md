# Honours Workshop - 3/10/22
## Lecture 4 - Primary Research and Advice for Writing the project

Hints on practical aspect/primary research.

All project work needs to have a practical component.

Friday deadline for project specification form is loose, it's not marked so there's no possibility of losing marks towards the honours project itself. 

### Importance of primary research
Core of research idea.
Worth the most marks.
Practical, hands-on work - software prototype, working with organisations, using simulation tools.

Important to think through, there's no time to go back and restart in T2.
Think about Plan B's where needed, just in case. 

Use tools in an informed way, carry out background reading into project as that sets the starting point for the practical element. Carry out sufficient reading around subject to understand what it is we're doing and why, could also think about other possible options, assess all potential and choose what's best - make sure to justify. 

Link between existing work and own research is important as it helps situate work, validate work and provide academic credibility. 

Project doesn't need to change world, should be a straightforward project to explore an idea. 

Research Methods;
Qualitative - indepth opinions
Quantative - broad surveys, statistics
Mixed - Mixture of both

Software Development methods - often a weak area
Examples;
+ waterfall
+ spiral
+ RAD - Rapid Application Development
+ Prototyping
+ Agile

WILL NEED TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH INTO DEVELOPMENT METHODS USED FOR DRIVER DEVELOPMENT

### Important
Must make stance clear and justify it
Description of other relevant methods then justify your approach
Using informed, backed up opinions. 
Final product might not work but can still discuss processes etc.
