Meet with Supervisor, discuss format and content of presentation beforehand.
What stage does supervisor expect you to be at at presentation point.
Need to show you have made good progress since interim report.

Think about slide number.
Over 10 slides might be too frantic
Less than 5 slides might be too slow
How do you incorporate slides with any possible demo of your work?

Camera needs to be on with appropriate background for privacy.

Strucure
+ Intro slide with area, aims, objectives
+ Slides that cover background information or literature review
+ Slides that cover research methodology underpinning work
+ Slides that discuss practical/empirical work e.g. design, development, simulations, experiment, interview and survey work.
+ Slides that discuss initial/expected results from work, how analysis is used/will be 
+ Slides that cover expected conclusions and future work

Advice
+ Preparation and rehearsal are key
+ Dont spend too much time on background information
+ Don't make bold unsubstantiated claims regarding work
+ Explain issue/problem that work is trying to address
+ Make sure its clear what work you have done
+ Don't get bogged down 
+ Keep track of time
+ Avoid just reading from notes/script, use notes/slides for prompts
+ Try to 'look' at the audience
+ Make sure slides are readable, don't have too much content
+ Try to speak at an audible level, don't shout or whisper
+ Make sure you can use Teams before the presentation
+ Make sure language is appropriate to subject area/level
+ Answer questions clearl and honestly (questions won't difficult and might be about why you chose x platform etc)
+ Try and show some interest and enthusiasm for project
