# 5/10/22 - Following the plan 
(19:32)
Right now, I'm going to submit my project spec sheet, get it out the way and submitted.

(19:44)
Now I'm going to work on my project plans for the rest of this year.

(19:54)
And now I'm going to read and take notes on 'Faults in Linux: 10 years later'

(20:56)
I read some of Faults in Linux, I caught myself thinking that it might not be entirely suitable to use in the project now. Maybe thats because the authors write that driver code no longer has the most errors? It's essentially a slightly more modern repeat of Chou et als Empirical study of OS errors. I think i'll have to include the paper and it's big brother anyway. 

Maybe I'm being too careful about trying to do relevant work. We'll need to see how the next work session goes. 

I've essentially started organising my literature review by trying to incorporate points into the dissertation layout AND by creating a list of reference citations. I think i'll work under  the pretense that if it becomes a reference then it's more than likely to be used in the project/dissertation. 

I need to keep in mind that my main focus now is creating a driver in the Rust programming language. This is something that I will develop and need to deliver on so I shouldn't get too wrapped up in things where I'm debating about their relevancy. I'm sure my literature review will help me get the blinkers on.

Ending day at 21:01.
