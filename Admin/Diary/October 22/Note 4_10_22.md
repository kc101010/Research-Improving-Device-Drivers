# 4/10/22 - Project spec form and related reading
(10:26)
This morning, most of my focus has been placed on the project specification form. Currently, I've completed almost everything, the last step is proof-read and then send off to Paul for feedback and signature and then Stephen for his signature. I, myself, am fairly happy with everything so far.

After proof-reading and making edits here and there, I think I'm happy to send this along to Paul considering it as a sort of final draft. After his feedback and/or signing, I can send it along to Stephen to feedback/sign. I should be able to make the Friday deadline at this stage.

I'm writing to Paul with the new project specification sheet.
