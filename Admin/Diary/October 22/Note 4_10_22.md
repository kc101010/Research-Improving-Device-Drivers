# 4/10/22 - Project spec form and related reading
(10:26)
This morning, most of my focus has been placed on the project specification form. Currently, I've completed almost everything, the last step is proof-read and then send off to Paul for feedback and signature and then Stephen for his signature. I, myself, am fairly happy with everything so far. 

(12:13)
After proof-reading and making edits here and there, I think I'm happy to send this along to Paul considering it as a sort of final draft. After his feedback and/or signing, I can send it along to Stephen to feedback/sign. I should be able to make the Friday deadline at this stage.

(12:30)
I'm writing to Paul with the new project specification sheet. 

(19:39)
Stephen has got back to me and has signed my project specification form. Everyone's happy and signed so the form is ready for submission. 

I'm going to continue plannning the next couple of months or so. I don't think there's anything else that I *need* to do so I'll make it my sole focus tonight - make sure I cover all bases (or as many as possible).
