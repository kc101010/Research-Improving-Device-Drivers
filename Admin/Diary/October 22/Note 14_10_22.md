Today I think I'm going to give the Rust driver options another go. To make things easy, I'm going to test on my workstation as I don't foresee any major issues. So today's tasks;

+ Build and Test Rust-For-Linux on my workstation.
+ Start putting together my literature review i.e. consolidate and start pulling out facts/findings etc
+ Possibly start writing the beginning of my interim report

I'm going to work through the same Rust-for-linux video as I did beforehand. Hopefully today will yield better results. It should because this machine has some of the necessary software already installed i.e. Flex, Bison.

Already feels like I'm having better results!

I've been able to follow through with zero issues thus far.

Achieved successfuly compilation of the kernel that will be used for this toolset!

I now have an instance of QEMU running Linux kernel 6!
I'm in better spirits that the last time I tried this!

I've edited some rust code to get an echo server sample to print while the Kernel is loading.

I'm testing the echo server.

I'm very happy with this but I think it's at a point where I can return later and pick up where I left off. Timestamp 50:00 in the setup video.

Now, I'm going to take a short 20 mins or so break and then work on my literature review. The files for this qemu box are stored outside of the git repo specifically in Uni/RustForLinux.

I may need to recompile/setup the pi kernel to generate the workspace found in the VM on to a physical machine which would be more suitable for this project.
