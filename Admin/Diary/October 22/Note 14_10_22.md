Today I think I'm going to give the Rust driver options another go. To make things easy, I'm going to test on my workstation as I don't foresee any major issues. So today's tasks;

+ Build and Test Rust-For-Linux on my workstation.
+ Start putting together my literature review i.e. consolidate and start pulling out facts/findings etc [x]
+ Possibly start writing the beginning of my interim report [x]

I'm going to work through the same Rust-for-linux video as I did beforehand. Hopefully today will yield better results. It should because this machine has some of the necessary software already installed i.e. Flex, Bison.

(14:45)
Already feels like I'm having better results!

(15:14)
I've been able to follow through with zero issues thus far.

Achieved successfuly compilation of the kernel that will be used for this toolset!

I now have an instance of QEMU running Linux kernel 6!
I'm in better spirits that the last time I tried this!

I've edited some rust code to get an echo server sample to print while the Kernel is loading.

I'm testing the echo server.

I'm very happy with this but I think it's at a point where I can return later and pick up where I left off. Timestamp 50:00 in the setup video.

Now, I'm going to take a short 20 mins or so break and then work on my literature review. The files for this qemu box are stored outside of the git repo specifically in Uni/RustForLinux.

I may need to recompile/setup the pi kernel to generate the workspace found in the VM on to a physical machine which would be more suitable for this project.

In the last couple of hours, I've been working on the beginnings of my interim report! I currently have 257 words written of (around 2750). I've split my report in the following way

+ Overview (500 words)
+ Literature Review (1000 words)
+ Preliminary Work (500 words)
+ Current progress, future work (750 words)

This planned layout matches all requirements and advice given in Honours workshops and certainly meets the guideline of between 2.5 and 3k words. 

To summarise todays accomplishments so far;
+ I now have the beginning of a working environment where I can eventually start writing Rust device drivers and toying with Rust in terms of Kernel use.
+ I have began writing my interim report, with around half of my overview section complete thus far.

(20:53)
At the moment, I'm going to take a break and return later to finish setting up my Rust driver environment on my workstation. 

I'd like to note, it feels good having carried out so much work before the year even started and even better that I've done everything through git and GitHub so I can give the most accurate access dates on references.
