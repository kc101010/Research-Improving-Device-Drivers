I hooked my new hard drive into my Pi. It just works and required no configuration. I now plan on trying to install the RustForLinux kernel into my pi.

I tried setting the kernel up on my pi but ultimately decided that I should try this out on a Virtual Machine beforehand just to make sure I don't harm my Pi in any way.

I have created a new Debian VM with plenty of space to practice installing a new linux kernel from source.

I have added to my literature review on the topic of memory safety/unsafety. This *might* be sufficient but I do think that I should think about adding more to it. Currently, I think it needs more content from Gaynor, specifically on what memory safe and unsafe languages. I could also do with looking into my notes on other papers and add in related info to beef up the section. I should note, this might not be necessary as it could put me over my word count. 

I think I should focus on finishing the report and then returning to sections that I want to review if the word count allows for it. (Or if it's absolutely necessary).
