Today, I'm going to continue the 'writing a linux kernel module in Rust' tutorial. I also plan on continuing work on my interim report. I sent an update to Paul, he wrote in his reply that I have a lot for my interim report so I should maybe consider using content from my diaries within the report (with a higher, report standard obviously.)

(11:12)
To be honest, I've just started working. I'm watching the video and following with the tutorial. I want to note what the speaker is saying; For this specific setup, we are generating a static module that is loaded/run as the kernel boots which is why we need to constantly recompile the kernel. It is possible to build the Rust module into .ko.

This is something I'll need to look into for when I build the latest kernel with Rust on my pi. There is an out of tree example in the Rust-for-Linux repo which I think is probably useful.

Rust; All fields in a struct must be initialised which differs from C. 

(11:21)
I have now managed to register the Rust driver in my Linux VM! 

![[AchievedDeviceReg.png]]
This code listing registers a driver which can be observed in the first column of the terminal, underneath the random entry. As I also have an implementation of the  'read' method, I decided to run `cat` on the directory as I was reminded of the char driver that I wrote in C.

![[DriverCodeWorking.png]]

Just like the C char driver, running cat on the entry makes a call to our drivers re-implementation of 'open' which then prints that file was opened! I think the error is simply due to the fact that scull is a directory.

(11:32)
The speaker was able to shorten some of his registration code as the Rust compiler can essentially fill in the blanks.

So his line; 
`let _reg = miscdev::Registration::<Scull>::new_pinned(fmt!("scull"), ())?;`

was changed to 

`let _reg = miscdev::Registration::new_pinned(fmt!("scull"), ())?;`

(11:43)
The reason for cat failing is that the module doesn't implement a read or write. 

(11:53)
Issues with commands throwing errors were fixed by implementing a read/write to the driver. This is essentially the char driver but in Linux form. I should be able to now make a comparison between C and Rust versions.

Speaker; Using the last statement without a semicolon then it's value is the return value of that block. It's equivalent to;

`return Ok(VALUE);`

## Comparison

Below are code listings for both the Rust and C drivers, they have different names but are essentially equiavlent, especially in terms of general functionality.

![[CharDrv-C.png]]
![[CharDrv-Rust.png]]

These code listings are fairly similar. I do prefer how Rust sets out file operations, its part of the Scull struct and is encapsulated in its own block where, in C, the file operation methods aren't encapsulated anywhere and are then assigned to a file operations struct. I feel that Rust has made an improvement over C in this regard.

I also like the Rust improvement in that `module_init` continues to exist but `module_exit` isn't present, I assume it is handled automatically. 

While both are fairly similar, I feel that the Rust code and its compartmentalisation make for better readability. We'll be able to observe more improvements/differences especially in terms of performance and safety. 

(14:31)
Well, I've written the char driver in Rust and have now experienced the basics of writing both Rust and C drivers. I've compared each and highlighted where I think Rust makes improvements. 

The next steps (specifically for the end deliverable/driver);
+ Conduct research into controlling physical devices through drivers (this will hopefully inform what device I decide to work on)
+ Compile and Build a 6.1 Rust-enabled kernel onto my Raspberry Pi, essentially re-creating my virtual environment on my Pi - I think I'll need to buy additional storage for this task
+ Eventually start working on the driver (this might be something that I can start fairly soon)

I'm currently looking into drivers for a generic USB mouse. I think that having a semi-working mouse controlled by a Rust driver would be really impressive even just to myself. It also works out well, I have the mouse that came with the Pi and I have a spare in the house so I have 2 test devices to work with. 

Here are some resources on mouse drivers that may help
+ [Linux Kernel, implementers API guide, Linux USB API, Writing USB device drivers](https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/usb/writing_usb_driver.html)
+ [Linux Today - How to Write Linux Mouse Drivers](https://www.linuxtoday.com/blog/linux-mouse-drivers/)
+ [Linux Device Drivers actually includes a USB mouse driver](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15322953/13699926) (There is mention of 'mouse' in chapter 13 about USB)

(15:28)
It seems these are the best resources, I suppose this consolidates the fact that I plan to build a driver for a generic USB mouse. I don't really know what I could choose as a backup but that's something I can discuss with Paul tomorrow at our meeting.
