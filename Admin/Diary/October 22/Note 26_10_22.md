Today I had a meeting with Paul. It's left me even more excited and inspired to keep working. He's very happy with my work/progress so far.

One thing I'd like to note from the meeting, I should have a look into the Rust documentation and gain some knowledge in how Rust works and conncets to the rest of the Linux kernel. It would likely make for an interesting section in my interim report/thesis. 

The end deliverable has been decided, Paul is happy with it, I plan on writing a driver for a Generic USB Mouse with a planned backup as a Rust Scull driver based on the example for LDD3. 

I'll need to obtain additional storage so that I can set the Pi up as a development machine. 

Today, I think I'm going to focus on my inetrim report as I keep planning this in my diaries but never get round to it.

After making an job application, I now plan on starting todays task.

I've struggled to retain focus but have managed to make a small contribution to my literature review, I now have around 442 words written on Rust. I'm not sure if this section needs more work or I could just continue on to another section. 

I think I'll call it here. I'll return to work on my report later in the week.
