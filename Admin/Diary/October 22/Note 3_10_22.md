# 3/10/22 - First Formal Feedback Meeting.

Today, I have a meeting in roughly half an hour with Paul, my supervisor. I plan on considering this the first formal feedback and management meeting as I missed the opportunity for this last due to my holiday. All necessary files are in Admin/MgmtFeedbackMeetings and I will take formal minutes. 

I don't think I'll have time for project work today, my main focus has been catching up on missed lectures and then I have work later on. I've made time to focus on this during the week.

## Project spec form
+ Put a few things in
+ Achieveable first-class goals for project
+ Passable project - anything clear and obvious, using GitHub, certainly will achieve
+ First class - things that are a little more ambitious, don't need to meet *all* points, think about still addressing those points and why they weren't prioritised etc.
+ Things to take responsbility over, be inspired by them
+ Some can be general


## Driver type
+ Could keep things broad and decide later
+ Potential to create own peripheral if targets are met



----

Graphs etc in article about Asahi GFX Driver. Take a look and see if it can be incorporated into project

Look for things that are experimental. Measuring memory safety.

Potential for creating graphs based on data from my driver? 

Look into linux drivers and see how they work, what does a keyboard driver rely on. Different types of drivers then run tools on that source code. 

Prefer peer-reviewed publications or books.
If using articles, keep them under 20%. Cover main stories, get as good a publication as possible. Could place more in introduction. 


Next Major Milestone; project spec sheet then interim report

Mix between literature review and development. 

Next meeting week 24/10/22
