So far, I have been working on my interim report. I have completed the majority of my Overview section but I think it needs some more work. To break things up, I've moved onto my literature review and I'm conducting research into Rust. At the moment, I'm gathering information on its History as I obviously want to provide a bit of background on the Rust programming language. 

I'm essentially following the report plan as closely as possible. 

Later on I also hope to test out Rust samples on my BusyBox VM that I finished setting up as I should really get the ball rolling in terms of writing Rust drivers.

I've managed to finish the Overview section. I'll need to back, proof-read and make improvements where needed but it is first-draft-done. I've also started writing some of my literature review specifically with regards to Rust.

I have made some further improvements to the overview, specifically where I made claims without citations/proof. I feel really good about the work I've done.

I'm going to take a break until 1600 and then start testing Rust samples on my busybox machine.

I'm not exactly sure when I returned from my break but I have been working on a scull driver in Rust on my Rust Linux VM. I'm following the mentorship video.

So far, I've got the basic structure of a Rust kernel module. This scull module is loaded on boot. As we can see, here is some Rust driver code running on Linux!

Here is the current code listing for the scull driver.

I'm going to end the work day here. I have completed my 2 main tasks for day and I now have working Rust driver code running in a Linux box. I'm very happy and excited about this and it feels like the first of many accomplishments within the project.
