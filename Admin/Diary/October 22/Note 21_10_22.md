It has been a short while since I last worked on my project. In my last diary, I detailed how I followed a video tutorial on how to configure and compile a VM with the newest Linux kernel w/ the first Rust capabilities. After struggling in days before, I finally managed to get everything working by using my main workstation. 

What I might do at some point is update to the latest kernel on my Raspberry Pi and that way I'll likely be able to access all these rust features, it may be necessary to compile and configure the kernel. 

To break up the day, I then moved onto focusing on the interim report. I managed to start writing and decided a layout for said report.

I'm almost an hour into the environment video, its starting to feel like the host is focusing on small things that aren't entirely necessary for me. I don't think my VM needs internet access especially since this is a test config. 

I've been struggling with focus but I hope today will build some momentum that will help me continue. The plan is to keep working for the rest of the day and then continue again on Sunday, spending most of the day. 

Today I plan to complete the following tasks
+ Essentially finish configuring the Rust Linux VM
+ Begin test Rust driver samples provided alongside the VM
+ Continue working on my interim report and related research

I think these tasks are very reasonable for today.

So I'm going to scrub through the rest of the environment video that I've been working from. I'll then need to move onto the other video focused on writing Rust drivers for Linux.

Actually, I think i will need to keep working from the video, I might not need internet but I could do with some other things like the dev directory having entries. This video is a bit of a pain and it would be nice if this were a written tutorial/document that I could work from, this entire process would've likely been much quicker.

I'm in the middle of configuring telnet so I have the ability to open several terminal sessions to the VM.

I'm essentially finished with the video, it has 9 minutes to go. After finishing the video, I'm going to switch to my interim report. If I have time/energy after carrying out some work on the report, I'll then look into the other video - writing linux kernel mods with Rust.

The end of the video really just focuses on how documentation is written into the code as comments which can then be read by the IDE (if the feature is supported) so in Codium, I can hover over a specific term and a small box containing the documentation will appear at my cursor.

I saw most of the video through (up until the QnA). I'm now going to take a very brief break, around 10-15 mins and then continue work on my report.
