## 29/8/22 -- Looking into driver issues 

(~3:20pm)
Today I've mainly taken notes on the Dingo device driver architecture. It's highlighted various issues (specifically errors) within device drivers. 

In the last few days, I emailed my supervisor with an update on my progress so far. Among his comments, he mentioned Alastair donaldsons group at Imperial college london and that I might be creating a list of publications from this group. I'm going to follow through with that as it will provide a great resource which hopefully covers a fair amount of ground in terms of drivers.  My supervisor also mentioned a couple of conferences next month that he thinks will be of benefit to me.

I'm going to start work on listing Donaldsons group work, return to taking notes on Dingo and then I'll maybe make some room for driver programming later tonight. 

(4:27pm)
Have started a list of Donaldsons and Deligiannnis' work. It'll very much be a constant progression as I continue to work on the project over the next wee while. Later tonight after work, I hope to maybe continue taking notes and do some driver programming. If I don't have time then that will be tommorrows task.
