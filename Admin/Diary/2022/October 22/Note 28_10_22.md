Today, I contributed to my report. I feel that I was excessive in writing about Rust for my interim report so I've reached out to Paul, my supervisor for feedback.

(14:03)
Paul is happy with my writing about Rust so I'll keep it. He also gave other helpful feedback on my report that I should take care to incorporate.

I feel like the contribution made to my report is sizeable so I'm going to take a short break and then continue my research into writing a driver for a USB mouse and working with USB i Linux kernel modules.

I wound up taking a longer break than I expected and have yet to start taking notes on USB drivers for Linux. I have signed up to the RustForLinux mailing list and I have also joined their Zulip chatroom.

My main worry right now is that the USB subsystem and related modules aren't actually available within the Rust kernel libraries. I'll need to see how this goes and if support is added in December with the release of Linux Kernel 6.1.

I'll need to conduct research into writing USB drivers for Linux and then check what's available in Rust. It seems like Rust For Linux is at the early stages of implementation with basic support at the moment.

From taking a look at the defintion of the Kernel library, these are the 'headers' which are currently available.

Obviously, this list does not include 'USB'. The `include` directory in Linux contains many more files when compared to the headers in this list.

Available Linux Headers (written in C) can be observed here. Note that this includes the USB library which I more than likely need in order to develop a USB mouse driver. If USB support is not implemented in the December 6.1 Kernel then I need to find another driver that I can implement.

I suppose that I could do the reverse? I could write a USB mouse driver in C and demonstrate where Rust would improve upon that? Worst-case, I try implementing what I really need from the C version in Rust?

I have just received a 160GB drive that I bought from Amazon. I can now configure the Pi to use the drive and once again attempt to set up RustForLinux as a VM or even attempt to install the kernel to the physical machine. 

(17:15)
I'm going to end the day here.

+ I have added to my report
+ I can now configure my Pi for use on the project
+ I now likely need to consider alternative drivers that I can work on with the discovery that the USB headers have no rust implementation - though I could mix C and Rust. 
+ I have begun taking notes on USB drivers.
