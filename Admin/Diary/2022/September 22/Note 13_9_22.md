At the moment, I'm spending a little bit of time on figuring out research questions for the project. Stephen Devine is happy to moderate if Paul is happy with the oppurtunities for research. I've added both their names to my project specification sheet. As noted in my last diary, I'll have to spend some time this week on ironing out the project and figuring out exactly what I plan on doing. 

Shortly, I'm going to spend time studying for my modules. Later after dinner, I'm going to return to work on the project.

I'm going to work on figuring out the project as I've been discussing in recent diaries.

I worked on a new project layout that feels more concise than previous but now my main worry is that the project is too short to match the 10-15k word count expected of the final honours report. I think I'll need to continue work until I feel comfortable and/or seek guidance from Paul.
