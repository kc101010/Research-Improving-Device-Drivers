## 1/9/22 -- Coding and Note-taking

An idea I've had in the last couple of days; In order to practise Rust, why don't I re-write my Systems Programming Concepts work into Rust? File locking and all. I could also work on Linux Systems Programming (the book by - i think - M. Kerrisk), transferring the C code into Rust. I think I'll try that today and then resume taking notes on Dingo. 

(1:28pm)
I've been working on a UNIX domain socket client and server in rust. I've used a few different resources to create these (as well as looking at SPC code). I had trouble in my first attempt but moved on to another resource where the code at least compiled. I tried testing the server and client but could not get them to communicate. 

#### Resources:
[Kyle M. Douglass - A simple UNIX socket listener in Rust (this is essentially the code used for my server)](http://kmdouglass.github.io/posts/a-simple-unix-socket-listener-in-rust/) 
[Rust documentation on Unix Net module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/net/index.html)
[Rust by Example - Unix Sockets (CODE WOULD NOT WORK)](https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~cs146a/rust/rustbyexample-02-21-2015/sockets.html) 
[Rust: The Cargo Book - Features (As By Example could utilised features)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html)

A screencap of my attempt to get messages through to the server. I later realised that the client only sent a couple of messages and didn't take input in this way but absolutely nothing appeared on the terminal so I gave it a go anyway.

I did note however that the physical socket file was created so I assumed that its just a simple case of one side not getting through to the other. The client is currently programmed to send a couple of messages.

Here is a current listing of all code.

As I was having issues, I continued reading through the server resource until I came across a section where the writer used `nc` (netcat) to send messages to the server. I decided to use this and - voila - I could communicate to the server.

So i'll have to go back and re-write the client in such a way that it can take messages as input and then send these messages through to the server. Hopefully that will get both the client and server programs to properly communicate. 

(14:30pm)
I worked on the client and wound up with this code. Some of it isn't in use yet but the main aspect is taking in a message then trying to write it to the server.

I tested this writing functionality and these are the results.

So the message is being received now, I just need to find a way to get the users input displayed on the terminal rather than `{message}`. This is a really fun exercise, I'm really enjoying and It's really interesting to see the differences in effectively the same programs in Rust and C. I'll add screenshots of my C domain sockets code for comparisons.

I've taken a shift at work tonight so this will conclude my work for now. I'll commit what I have and return to it later. I'll add the final code into the `Rust/code` directory later.
