Today, I'm going to rebuild the kernel on my VIrtualBox instance. I'm going to try and start development on my Rust driver. I'd at least like to have a skeleton set up and everything ready to continue in the next few days.

In my opinion and based on own experience, it is much easier to build a driver development environment on architectures such as amd64 etc over arm/arm64 found on the raspberry pi.

The new kernel has successfully built on the VM though there seems to be a handful of issues with the OS generally. Hopefully running typical updates will fix these issues.

Command to build our Rust modules.
`sudo make LLVM=1 -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD modules`

I will return to this work on boxing day.
