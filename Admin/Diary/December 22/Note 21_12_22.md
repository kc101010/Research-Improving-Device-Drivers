Yesterday, I spent some time once again trying to compile kernel 6.1 on the Raspberry Pi. I've made no progress and I don't think it's totally feasible to use the Pi. I'll either need to use my own workstation or the VirtualBox instance. 

The Raspberry Pi runs into build issues related to dt-bindings. I'm not totally sure what's going on. I think I previously noted this but I'm slightly surprised that there's a difference between building a kernel for a Pi and building on general hardware. 

Today, I'm going to work on dissertation research etc. I'm currently at my partners and won't be home until the 23rd so won't have access to my workstation.
