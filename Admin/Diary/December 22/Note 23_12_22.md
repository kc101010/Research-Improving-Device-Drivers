Today, I'm working on my memory safety section. Mainly by following the advice given in my interim report feedback. Right now, I'm looking into Microsoft Project Verona.

Notes have been taken on Project verona, so now I'm going to move onto Garbage Collection, I think I might discuss Go in this section also. Go is a language that I have passing interest in so this should be useful.
