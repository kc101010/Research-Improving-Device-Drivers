Today, I'm working on my memory safety section. Mainly by following the advice given in my interim report feedback. Right now, I'm looking into Microsoft Project Verona.

Notes have been taken on Project verona, so now I'm going to move onto Garbage Collection, I think I might discuss Go in this section also. Go is a language that I have passing interest in so this should be useful.

I have taken some notes on Garbage collection also and have some info on the D programming language. I think this is a small step of many with regards to my research on garbage collection. I also have a paper that I thought would be useful but not 100% sure and will need to look into it. When I get home, I plan on trying to get some practical work done whether that be building Linux 6.1 on my workstation or starting to program the driver on the 6.1 VM. Regardless, I will have some sort of practical work started.
