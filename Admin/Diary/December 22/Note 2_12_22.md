A couple of days ago, I continued my research into the USB protocol. I don't think there's anything notable to say or record about it. I feel that I'm gaining good insight into USB especially with the programming guide that I'm reading through.

I have yet to start working on solving the issue with the Raspberry Pi, I really just hope that I turn it on and everything just works. 

Yesterday, I found an interesting article that I plan on taking notes from titled "Google reports decline in Android memory safety vulnerabilities as Rust usage grows". I was recommended this by my google app which provides a range of articles throughout the day. It's proving to be a fairly useful resource! While I have yet to properly read the article, this is another general fact that helps build the case for Rust.

I can certainly tie this into memory safety, if there are numbers/figures then I should note them and then compare them to 2019. This article *may* be a very useful source in establishing more recent figures.

Right now I plan taking some notes on the article. After getting some sleep and whatever else I need to do, I plan on spending some time on the project. 

I'd say my main tasks are:
+ Fix the Raspberry Pi
+ Continue USB research
+ Write another Systems program in Rust

I'd like some practical coding work so let's find another systems programming task or something to re-write and test in Rust. This can be added to my code collection.

This article was really useful and I managed to find the original google security blog post, I will return to this tomorrow. I could probably get 2/3 of the above tasks (alongside these notes on google) completed later today.
