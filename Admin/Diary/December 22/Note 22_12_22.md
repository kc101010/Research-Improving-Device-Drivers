Yesterday, I worked on my section for Memory Safety and my section on Google Android 13 and Rust.  I haven't went back to the Pi and don't think I will for this project. Today, I've worked on very minor tasks such as small edits and making sure all my reference citations are in order. Tomorrow, I'll hopefully work on another dissertation section or at least conduct the research for it.
