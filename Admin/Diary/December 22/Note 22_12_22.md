Yesterday, I worked on my section for Memory Safety and my section on Google Android 13 and Rust.  I haven't went back to the Pi and don't think I will for this project. Today, I've worked on very minor tasks such as small edits and making sure all my reference citations are in order. Tomorrow, I'll hopefully work on another dissertation section or at least conduct the research for it.

What I could do is write a mouse driver solely in C then use parts of that code within Rust to create the Rust version of that C driver. This way I could write the C code on really any of my devices (including the Pi) then when it comes to the Rust driver, I would need to use either my workstation or the VM. This could also assist in comparing C and Rust.
