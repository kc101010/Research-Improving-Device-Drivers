Today I finished off my notes on Googles security blog for Android 13 and Rust. I also put a bit of work into my dissertation layout and take it a step closer to the final product/report. It certainly feels like things are starting to come together a bit more. I'm not exactly sure what else I'm going to do today but I do want to keep myself busy before I need to go to work!

Earlier, I sent a project update to my Project supervisor Paul. I've also conducted some minor  research on why C++ was not used within the Linux kernel. I'll be going to work soon but hopefully I'll be able to work on the project later tonight when I finish.
