Today, I'm finalising the Rust-for-linux 6.1 kernel build on my machine. At the moment, I am recompiling the kernel. Previously, I was able to get the kernel (without rust support) to build and install however I don't think theres a decent graphics driver for this kernel as my second monitor has stopped working. Just means I can set my pi up whenever I'm doing development work. After all, it is recommended to build drivers with 2 machines.
