Today, I'm finalising the Rust-for-linux 6.1 kernel build on my machine. At the moment, I am recompiling the kernel. Previously, I was able to get the kernel (without rust support) to build and install however I don't think theres a decent graphics driver for this kernel as my second monitor has stopped working. Just means I can set my pi up whenever I'm doing development work. After all, it is recommended to build drivers with 2 machines.

After building with Rust support and installing the new kernel, it boots but hangs on the message "Loading initial ramdisk ...". I've tried to rebuild and reinstall but that doesn't seem to work, I believe it could be some kind of configuration issue but not 100% on the cause. I've still to properly diagnose the issue, but I'm also considering starting from scratch.

I believe that running `make LLVM=1 -j6 defconfig` might have something to do with it as thats the only new command I entered when building Linux 6.1 with Rust. It's a bit frustrating.
