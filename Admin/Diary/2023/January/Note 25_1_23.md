Today, I'm going to focus on research. I'm a bit unsure about development now so I'd like to get actually get some work done. I'll also need to make sure I organise my next meeting with Paul.

Everything is prepared for the next formal meeting, just to email Paul and ask for his availability. Now, I'm going to work on my dissertation, specifically the section on Operating System drivers and Apples restructuring of Kernel Extensions.
