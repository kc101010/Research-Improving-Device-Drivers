I've decided to try and build the RustForLinux repo on my workstation. Doing this means I will have an easier time working with physical devices throughout my project. Whether I go back to the original plan of making a USB mouse driver, I'm not sure but I at least have the possibility to implement it. 

It seems that the easiest way to get through is project is by working on physical hardware as much as possible.
