Today, as per advice of Miguel Ojeda, I'm going to delve into writing a C version of my mouse driver.

Maybe developing a mouse driver is a bit overkill and pointless?  I'm not sure but it might be a good idea to reconsider what kind of driver I'm going to write. I think this task would be much easier to work through if I was on physical harware, theres a lot of a messing about to be done with the VirtualBox if I want to write a mouse driver on it.

So for the sake of ease (and time), might be better to look to other options - possibly the virtual devices which were previously discussed as a fallback. I just think that for the sake of keeping everything on track, its the best option. I'll look into what I can work on, possible come up with my own idea? Not sure.
