Ojeda has gotten back to me and has given some great advice! He also provided me with a few useful resources;

[A blog post about the history of RustForLinux](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/memory-safety-in-linux-kernel/)

He recommended that I get used to reading the C side of the kernel even If I only plan on working in Rust.
He also recommended that I read up on device drivers and [provided a potential list](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.2-rc1/process/kernel-docs.html).

On the Rust driver, he recommended that I write a C version which can then act as a reference, will allow me to learn APIs that I will use in Rust and means I can double-check if issues are due to Rust support or my own code.

He also spoke of the monthly informal meetings which he thought might be beneficial for me - these meetings are for connecting with others in the RustForLinux community, presenting yourself and keeping up to date with happenings in the community/project. 

Asahi Lina is still to get back to me - hopefully I will hear back soon.  

Yesterday, I also sent off another routine update to Paul.
