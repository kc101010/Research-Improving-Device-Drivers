Final deadline is under a month away for this project. It feels like yesterday I was only writing the proposal...

Today, I made progress on dissertation writing! Word count sits at 5,722. I'm trying to wrap up the literature review to then move onto other sections of the report. Within Lit review: Memory safety, I expanded a little bit on Garbage collection and created a new but related subsection 'Reference Counting'. To round out my literature review, I also wrote out a summary of the main points of each section and tried bringing them together to make some wider points/claims. I made sure to write the summary in a way that each paragraph links to the next but also links back to the report content and connects most if not everything.

I've already started planning out my development section and what I want to cover. Funnily enough, its the only section of my report that I *didn't* pre-plan. I've also been thinking about how to write my acknowledgements and I might discuss this with Paul tomorrow. I already made clear in my presentation Q+A that development is essentially finished but I may continue to pursue the mouse driver as a future project.

When I make my final submissions, I'll need to look into the lectures that Mark has put out to make sure my final report is as suitable as possible.

At the moment, I'm going to take a break from writing and work on paperwork for tomorrows formal management meeting.
