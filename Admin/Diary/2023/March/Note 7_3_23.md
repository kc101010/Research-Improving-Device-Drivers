Today, I've continued my dissertation work. Total word count sits around 6,715 with the word count for my development sitting somewhere around 1600. I've notice that going back in my diaries and research has helped open up new sections in development and basically fill in gaps and so on. In using the diaries and notes, the dissertation writing feels quite smooth and easy. Obviously I'll have to go over everything, proof-read, edit, improve and so on but so far I feel fairly confident in my writing and that I may even have a full first draft available for Paul within the next couple of weeks.
