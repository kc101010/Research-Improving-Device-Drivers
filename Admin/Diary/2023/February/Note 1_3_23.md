Today I'm continuing work on dissertation writing. I'm currently taking notes on the memory safety blog the Miguel Ojeda wrote about the Rust for Linux project. 

I've also noticed that there is more work on the USB support for the Rust For Linux project, it doesn't seem that any of it has been merged into the project but the commits now introduce a USB example which can built alongside the other samples. A USB driver may be more possible but I think at this stage, I should shelve this idea and save it. Potentially for a Master project, possibly a personal project or even a contribution to Rust for Linux. 

As a note, the formal meeting has been moved from today in the afternoon to tomorrow at 1100 as today is a lecturer strike day.
