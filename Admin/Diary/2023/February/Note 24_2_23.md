Dissertation word count currently sits at 4,230 words. I've completed the 'general concepts' subsection in the background. I think some more work should be carried out on the Garbage collection section, then the section on exo-kernel. After these, I feel I should move onto other sections within the dissertation.  

Obviously, there has been a short gap in diary entries. Recently, most time has spent on creating my presentation for the project. On Wednesday (22nd), I presented to my supervisor. The next day, provisional marks were given to me at 85! I'm very proud of this and I'm seriously aiming to gain a first class for this project. 

At the moment, I see development as 'finished' in terms of the project. If there are any serious developments then I may consider going back to developing but as of now, my main focus is completing the dissertation and making sure everything goes smoothly for the next month.
