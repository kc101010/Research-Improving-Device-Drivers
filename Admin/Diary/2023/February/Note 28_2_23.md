Today I wrote and completed the exokernel section. Hopefully, I'll make some progress on the garbage collection bit of my memory safety section. I've also organised another formal meeting with Paul for Friday.

I have met the halfway mark of my dissertation, with the total word count sitting around 5,126 words.
