Today, I've been continuing to add to my dissertation with a focus on Garbage Collection. Word count currently sits at ~4,098w. I think I should soon close out the garbage collection section in order to focus on other sections and add more work. Probably as expected, the literature review takes up the majority of the word count. I think if I use the rest of the lit. review to reach 5k and then switch focus to other sections. 

I really need to start work on my presentation which I think I'll do today. I want to do a brief outline of what information I'd like to share.

Presentation has started with a theme based on 'The Fragile' by Nine Inch Nails which I felt was fitting.
