21/8/22 -- Changing work to be relevant to Project

Lately I feel like the work i've been carrying out, while useful, doesn't 100% cover the goals of the project or could likely be carried out at a later time. I think it makes sense to re-prioritise/ shift focus.

Today, I'll make that shift. Focusing on the following aims/research points;
+ discussing implementation across various OS and differences
+ relations between drivers and kernel

Currently I've researched debugging tools and improving driver code via Rust. I'll continue to learn how to write driver and rust code but will work on less research.

Today the plan is:
+ Work on some Rust systems code
+ Research differences between OS drivers
