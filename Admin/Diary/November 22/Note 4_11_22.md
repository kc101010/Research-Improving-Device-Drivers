So i've managed to install rust-bindgen however I still can't build the driver or run `make rust-analyzer`

![[errorRustAnalyzer.png]]![[TargetJSONerror.png]]

So it's *possible* to build a Rust driver but I'm held back by not being able to run `make rust-analyzer` . It's hard to tell what's causing the issue.

![[MakefileRustAnalyzer.png]]

So this is the makefile with the rust-analyzer code. 

$(Q) seems to stand for Quiet and indicates whether or not a command should be displayed (which will be based on whether the verbose marker is used.)

$(MAKE) is first used in a command which invokes a second make in the output directory, my guess is that it simply represents an instance of Make

$(build) seems to indicate where Make should carry out a build command on something

$@ seems to represent the currrent command to carry out? 

So I think this Makefile line basically says

{Use output control} {Instance of Make} {Build this:} rust (current command): rust-analyzer

(15:38)
So it tries to use rust to build the rust-analyzer? Maybe I need to install the rust-analyzer extension to the vscode instance on the VM. I'll try this now.

First I need to install vscode as I've yet to install it.

It makes sense that I need the rust-analyzer addon via VScode to generate the json file. I didn't have this issue on my workstation, although it didn't have the extension, it did have several rust components installed to VScodium.

For this VM i'll simply use VSCode to simplify things.

No dice, I checked rustavailable and I now have a new issue.

This issue can be solved by running `rustup component add rust-src`. This does not solve the rust-analyzer issue.

(15:50)
I have also run `rustup update`

(15:58)
I've decided to run `make V=1 rust-analyzer` with `V` representing Verbose output.

I wonder if there's some sort of file missing which is causing this error. I remember having a view issues with `rust.config`?

![[MakeRustConfigAnalyzer.png]]

So running `make rust.config` provides these extra lines though the make file still throws error 2 anyway.

I've came across [this resource](https://wusyong.github.io/posts/rust-kernel-module-01/) which, again, documents the Linux foundation video. I think the rust-analyzer issue is down to me missing a step..... eek!

I have run the following
`make LLVM=1 rustfmt`
`make LLVM=1 CLIPPY=1`

I next need to run 
`make LLVM=1 rust-analyzer`

and hopefully the issue will be fixed, it may be that I simply needed to use LLVM and that was the issue all along.

(16:10)
I'll be very happy to even see an error with the test driver code after this.

The `rust-analyzer` issue continues even after running those commands and trying to make it with LLVM. I'm restarting the VM to see if the issue magically fixes.

After restart, the issue continues.

(19:00)
I'm going to run some of the previous commands and then try re-installing the kernel.

(19:33)
My VM is broken AGAIN and once again drops to a busybox shell. 

(19:37)
Making sure i run modules and modules_install before make install.

I'm getting really fed up with this and I'm starting to doubt the viability of some of this project especially in regards to it running on a Pi 400.


(19:43)
So make tags `rusttest`, `rust-analyzer` and `rustdoc` do not work at all. If this is the case, I have missed a step and will need to figure out what's missing. 

(19:58)
So the `rust-analyzer` command calls a python script; `/scripts/generate_rust_analyzer.py`

I THINK THE MAKE IS FAILING BECAUSE PYTHON ISN'T INSTALLED

(20:09)
Nope, No dice again.

I have absolutely no clue what's going on.

(20:25)
It's hard to tell what is causing this problem, what I find weird is that only 3 rust commands are affected.

It doesn't seem to a python issue

It could be something to do with rustup? I've noticed a .rustup folder in my workstations home folder that isn't present on the VM. I've tried messing around with rustup and that's done nothing. 

(20:41)
So I've found that the Rustup folder actually exists in the home folder of my Root account. Maybe I need Rustup available on my User account?

(20:45)
I've installed to my user account but this hasn't helped anything.

(20:51)
This problem is really really stumping me. I could try recompiling and building completely with LLVM to see if that would help? With my previous problems in building and installing, something tells me it might help? I'll give it a go and see how it goes.

(21:20)
I'm moving to my fallback, I cannot get Rust to work on the VM and I expect the same and possibly more issues with the Pi. 

The plan now is to research other 'virtual' devices I can implement alongside 'scull'. That way I can have a small collection drivers that I can reference and use in my dissertation. The hope is that I'm more likely to be able to implement these drivers (as they'll hopefully make use of the most standard, common libraries.)
