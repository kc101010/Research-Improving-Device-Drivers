Today I plan on practising the compilation and installl of the latest Linux kernel with Rust suppoort on the Virtual Machine that I configured during my last work session.

I've been thinking about the project, I think it is unlikely that I can create a USB mouse driver though I could look into similar alternatives. 

The current focus is to get a Linux Rust Kernel running physically, if that can't happen then I need to move to my fallback and implement some kind of simulation or similar on the VM which is available on my workstation. I could look into re-writing some kind of utility in Rust?

I'm using [this resource](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/build-linux-kernel) to compile and install the latest kernel, hopefully this works and I can reproduce on my Pi! Provided that this compiles with no issue, I'll then have to write a Rust test module.

[This resource](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1329538/compiling-the-kernel-5-11-11) should be noted in case i run into a cert issue while compiling.

This is a very long process. In hindsight, I should have allocated a couple more CPUs to the VM.

I'll continue to let this run in the background and get on with other work.

At some point, I will need to test rust kernel modules on this machine! I'm very happy with this.

I'm getting close to compiling a rust kernel module on my VM instance.

Here's some relevant commands that I might need when setting things up on the pi .

`cargo install bindgen`
`apt install llvm-dev libclang-dev clang`

(22:14)
Little to no progress has been made. I'm sure that rust modules can be compiled but I've yet to get this working. 

(22:35)
This kernel takes a long time to build on this VM. I've even given it 4 CPUs so it's vaguely on par with the pi.

(23:02)
I tried to make and then install the kernel with LLVM which seems to have broken my installation, now i just drop to a busybox shell. I just managed to lose my progress for the entire day...

I've managed to bugger the 6.1 kernel that I built, luckily the 5 kernel is fine and can still be loaded via grub

(23:23)
I ran `make modules_install` and `make install` to hopefully fix the issue as I skipped over the former - this worked

(23:42)
I also managed to find a 'paper' version of the linux rust videos

I'm geting fed up with this. Test VM fixed, driver still hasn't compiled...
