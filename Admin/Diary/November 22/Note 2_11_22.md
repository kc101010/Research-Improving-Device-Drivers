Today I plan on practising the compilation and installl of the latest Linux kernel with Rust suppoort on the Virtual Machine that I configured during my last work session.

I've been thinking about the project, I think it is unlikely that I can create a USB mouse driver though I could look into similar alternatives. 

The current focus is to get a Linux Rust Kernel running physically, if that can't happen then I need to move to my fallback and implement some kind of simulation or similar on the VM which is available on my workstation. I could look into re-writing some kind of utility in Rust?

I'm using [this resource](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/build-linux-kernel) to compile and install the latest kernel, hopefully this works and I can reproduce on my Pi! Provided that this compiles with no issue, I'll then have to write a Rust test module.

[This resource](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1329538/compiling-the-kernel-5-11-11) should be noted in case i run into a cert issue while compiling.

This is a very long process. In hindsight, I should have allocated a couple more CPUs to the VM.

I'll continue to let this run in the background and get on with other work.
