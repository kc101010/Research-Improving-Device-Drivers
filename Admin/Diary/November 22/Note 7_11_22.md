I'm trying to fix the VM. I think that I need to build linux headers for the new kernel and thats what is causing problems for rust-analyzer and so on.

I'm also going to test whether C modules are able to compile. I need Makefile.symvers.

Thought: Making a full kernel which is ready for driver development is a teensy bit more complicated than I originally expected.

I think I might also need to wait until the final release of Kernel 6.1. That way, issues will (hopefully) be less likely.

After building headers and rebuilding modules for Module.symvers, I have verified that C modules can build.

NOTE: even after using su, insmod and rmmod require sudo

Rust-analyzer issue still not fixed. Tried to generate a json file through rustc but that wouldn't work. I'm not sure what's going on so the last thing to try is copying my json file from my workstation as Paul recommended.

Closing out for today as I have work.
