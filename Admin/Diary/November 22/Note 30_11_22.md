Progress has really slowed on the project. Lately, I've been focusing on coursework for other classes but I have also yet to solve the issue with the Raspberry Pi. I haven't had time to get a good look at the pi but I plan on doing within the week. 

Lately, the following has been accomplished
+ The interim report was finalised and submitted
+ Research on the USB protcol was properly started

During December, I should accomplish the following
+ Fix the Raspberry Pi
+ Finalise USB research
+ Start developing the USB production driver

It should be noted that if the Pi really doesn't work out then I could likely just do everything via VirtualBox. I'm not sure that this can 100% be viable but it is another potential avenue.

Today, I'm going to be researching the USB protocol. I'd like to get some technical knowhow on it while also learning how to utilise it within Linux drivers.
