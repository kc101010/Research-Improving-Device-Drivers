I've decided to quickly re-test the build VM but with the RustForLinux repo. If Rust-analyzer doesn't work on here then I'll try installing busybox to each in order to test if things improve.

The issue is present on the new build which is Linux 6.1-rc1+. BusyBox is not needed for this so there must be some other solution.

I have compared the makefile of the busybox VM and the original Debian VM. The rust support option is being hidden in the Debian VM for some reason.
