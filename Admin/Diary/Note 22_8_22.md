Today, I'll spend some more time researching how Windows device drivers work, how they're developed etc. If i'm able to, I might move onto another OS such as MacOS. 

I've almost finished taking notes on the windows driver doc paper. I also reorganised my research folder. Next, I plan on moving to another OS as the notes I would take for Windows don't seem overly vital or important. 

I took notes from Apples documentation. Apple is very interesting as they seem to implement drivers in a ringed security system. There are 3 different types suited for certain tasks.

+ Driver extensions - handles comms between custom hardware and rest of system (runs in user space)
+ System extensions - implements features that need kernel-level co-operation (runs in user space)
+ Kernel extensions - supports low-levels services that can't be implemented via a DExt or SysExt (runs in kernel space)

From reading Apples documentation, they want to make drivers as robust as possible while keeping their own systems etc as tightly knit as possible. I actually really like the idea of designated driver types but I wonder if there's some kind of overhead that results from this. 

I might work on some more Rust coding later but these notes essentially conclude todays work.
