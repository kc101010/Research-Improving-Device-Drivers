Today I have a few tasks that I'd like to work on
+ Configure my raspberry pi machine
+ Continue with figuring out project 
+ Work on some research via papers (take conclusions etc from securing dev drivers)

Right now, I think i'm going to work on configuring my pi.

I'd like to install the following;
+ Rust
+ Necessary software for writing Linux drivers
+ git (to make the project repo available) 

(14:13)
Rust installed
git was pre-installed
I'm about to test compile the char driver to ensure linux-headers are installed
I've installed codium, my preferred code editor

Note, to make headers available simply run
`sudo apt install linux-headers`

I've tried installing the headers several times but not getting any luck compiling the char driver. I think I'm on attempt number 4. 

(14:44)
I ran apt update and upgrade and now it looks like almost every piece of software on the machine is updating.  This will likely take a while.

I'm going to register the char driver onto the pi and essentially re-do some of Episode 6 by Karthik M. Notes here; [[Driver studying]]

(15:31)
Here's the results of the test compile

Here you can see cat being run on the driver entry (on the right terminal) and feedback from the driver itself (on the left terminalrmmorm)
