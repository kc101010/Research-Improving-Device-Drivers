Today's tasks
+ Figure out/work on figuring out project - ideally I should finalise it before I leave for holiday, then I can come back and write out the project specification sheet.
+ Take notes from conclusion (and other important areas) of 'Securing Embedded Device Drivers'
+ There seems to a be lot of news regarding Rust in the Linux kernel, I've saved some of these articles so I should takes notes on them and look for more.
