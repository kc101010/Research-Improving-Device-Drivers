## 11/9/22 - Rust systems tasks

(18:51)
Today, I plan on working on another systems task in Rust. I'm going to look at the Linux programming interface to find a task and either adapt the code or find another resource online.

I've decided to focus on memory management. I haven't found a task but I know what I'd like to work on. Good news, I was somehow invited to complete the google foo challenges.
