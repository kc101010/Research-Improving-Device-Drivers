## 11/9/22 - Rust systems tasks

Yesterday
(18:51)
Today, I plan on working on another systems task in Rust. I'm going to look at the Linux programming interface to find a task and either adapt the code or find another resource online.

I've decided to focus on memory management. I haven't found a task but I know what I'd like to work on. Good news, I was somehow invited to complete the google foo challenges.

This morning I spent an hour on the google foobar challenge and made some good progress with my solution for level 1. Now I'm going to find some memory management tasks etc for Rust.

I struggled to focus on anything for the entire day, so this task will be allocated for tommorow.
