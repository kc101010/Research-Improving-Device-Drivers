Today is the last day before I go on Holiday. I have a few articles regarding Rust that I would like to read through and take notes on. Today, I should also finalise or have a near-final project plan. 

Project work has slowed slightly as I've been trying to be ahead in coursework. As I've been working on this project for almost 2 months already.

I've taken notes on the most relevant articles. They definitley seem useful. Now onto figuring out project layout.

I've presently made a couple of small edits to the latest project layout., I think i'm fairly happy with this and it feels like somthing I can pull of during the year. It might be that I need to remove some unecessary points that wouldn't contribute much. 

As for a project title, my specification form currently holds the title "How can Rust be used to improve reliability in Linux Device Drivers.". I feel this matches very closely to the overall project itself; I'm focusing on Linux - specifcally device drivers (or kernel modules) and I'm trying to test if Rust can succesfully improve the reliability of these Device Drivers. It may not be a final title but is a good place holder to work from when I come back.

One note I should remember; I'll likely need to look into updating info given by some Research cc Rust Linux Drivers presentation.
