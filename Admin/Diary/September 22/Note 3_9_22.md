## 3/9/22 -- Fixing the domain socket client

Today I've managed to fix the issue where the client was sending only `{message}` to the server. It was somewhat simple requiring just a change in `write_all()`.

So in this new iteration of the code, rather than trying to use `.write_all("{message}")` I have instead just passed the string and converted it to bytes with `.write_all(message.as_bytes())`. I found this solution when I tried using the internet and came across [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65148329/unix-domain-socket-server-only-prints-message-when-client-closes) which used the same method. 

And here is a demo of the server talking to both the new and old client.

On the left terminal, you can see the server running with a mix of messages from the old and new client. On the right terminal, you can see the new client being run several times to send a few messages. 

 As I don't have access to my typical workstation at the moment. I'm using WSL to run Debian. I've installed DWM to this WSL machine and connected to it via the remote desktop program. This way I can use a gui rather than the pure command line than WSL typically provides. I had to recompile the code as I got some sort of glibc error with the original executables.

The next step will be to make the client loop so that the user can send messages as long as the connection the server is available. I'll work on this next time. 

I've really enjoyed this exercise of re-writing my systems programming class tasks in Rust. I'm going to continue doing so and try to cover some topics in Linux systems programming concepts.
