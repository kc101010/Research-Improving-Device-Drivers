## 7/9/22 -- Work from the last few days
(around 20:00)
Between the last diary and now, I've continued work reflected in commits between the 3rd and 7th of September 2022. On the 5th, I worked on 3 main tasks; Starting to build the project arguement, working on my glossary of key words and continued taking notes on the dingo driver architecture.

Today, I decided to finalise my notes on Dingo and start work on something else. I closed the dingo note out with a summary of the papers conclusion. 

I'd like to continue by working on the following tasks:
1. Research BSD/OpenBSD etc drivers so I can eventually compare differences between major OS vendors.
2. Continue working on my client code for the rust domain socket programs. Ideally, I'd like to develop a client program that stays open and allows the user to send multiple messages.

I've taken some notes on OpenBSD drivers. It's a totally different world. I'm now debating with myself on whether I should use these notes and compare the OpenBSD driver 'doc' to the official documentation for other Operating Systems. FreeBSD seems to have documentation which is on par with Linux, Windows, Apple so I might look into Free instead.

Before I work on my rust client code, I'd like to discuss some observations I've made between my Rust and C code. I do feel that these are essentially the same (or similar enough) and make for a fair enough comparison.

First of all, I feel that library calls are much cleaner. In C, lib calls each take up 1 line where Rust allows for many packages to be called from within a certain library, thus many calls can be made for 1 line. Here's what I mean.

Note that I refer to packages here and mean smaller sub-libraries or lib components.

Notice in this C excerpt that even smaller packages contained within `sys` take up an individual line. If we compare this to Rust.

Rust has allowed us to clean up our code and call library packages from a single line. You can see this used in line 1.

I also feel that the C code is much longer than that of Rust. Our Rust program uses 21 lines where the C program uses 57.

I'd also say that there is much more config code in the C program compared to Rust. In Rust, the Unix domain socket is held within a specified library `std::os::unix::net` however in C, the socket is held within a general library and must be configured.

Each purple highlight is a section of code that I feel is config code.

And this is what I feel constitutes config code in our Rust program. I will admit that I might not have written the Rust program to the same standard as the C and there could be missing code. Both programs are functional with no complaints/errors so I'd say the comparison stands.

Another observation on C that irks me, every single line of code is encapsulated by if, perror and exit. As much as this makes the code... more robust or gives better feedback to the developer, I do feel that this repeating pattern is too repetetive. I really like that my Rust code is short and simple whereas the C program tiptoes whenever it wants to do anything.

(21:30)
I've actually decided not to make changes to the domain socket client, it essentially provides the same behaviour as its C counterpart which makes for a better comparison in my eyes. When I next work, I will select another systems topic to work on in Rust. I may or may not compare code.  I would have discussed the server also but I think most of the same points whether or not I point them out. 

This concludes the work for today.  As tomorrow is my birthday, I'll return to work on this project on Friday the 9th.
