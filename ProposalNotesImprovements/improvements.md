## Methodology

+ Qualitative Research will be useful for finding out about specific thoughts and experiences from developers/experts. I feel that this will benefit my research by informing findings such as developer experience and how developers feel/think if I were to propose new ideas/tools to assist in their job
+ Quantative Research will be useful for calculating and later comparing figures such as how much of a kernel is dedicated to drivers, error rates, comparison of error rates between different OS'

+ I'd like to possibly reach out to driver maintainers/developers and ask about their experience in relation to kernel programming and the device they write for, to see if the finding that driver developers are more knowledgeable in the device continues to hold up
	+ I'd like to perform this by way of interviews, focus groups and/or surveys with many developers to try and generate new findings and test the old
	+ Focus groups provide the opporunity to open up discussion between the group on the topic at hand and will allow for insight into the various opinions of those present
	+ Interviews will allow for a more expanded 1-1 method of discovering ones thoughts and will allow me to tailor specific questions?
	+ It might be worth trying to find more recent research that could indicate if this is still the case
	+ It's possible that oss driver devs are more likely to specialise in a device over kernel programmming as open-source work is more motivated by the person wanting to better improve the product ? OSS software such as the Linux kernel makes documentation readily available so its possible devs hold expertise on device and then use docs for driver/kernel side
	+ It would make sense to test this with oss communities and closed-source companies if possible as oss is unlikely to represent how a more formal, corporation i.e. MS and Apple function
	+ Surveys can allow for a broad set of data to be collected. For instance, I could write a general survey that discusses/asks about experience, whether that experience is on a device or driver/kernel. Surveys could be filled via an online form and dispersed via oss mailing lists or provided to relevant managers in corporations, I feel they'll allow for a broad set of data to be collected as the surveys could be provided to several communities or companies
